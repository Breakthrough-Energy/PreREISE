# Introduction
REISE takes as input the power produced every UTC hour by each wind farm in the network. Wind speed data need first to be collected and then converted to power. The procedure used to achieve these goals is explained below.

# Data
1-hour resolution wind speed data are needed. In addition these data should be available for all the wind farms location in the network. In addition, the spatial resolution should be as good as possible.


Two datasets provide satisfy these requirements. The first one is the Techno-Economic WIND (Wind Integration National Dataset) Toolkit produced by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and the second one is RAP (Rapid Refresh) generated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).
* The Techno-Economic [WIND Toolkit](https://www.nrel.gov/grid/wind-toolkit.html) provides 5-min resolution data for 7 years, **ranging from 2007 to 2013**, at 120,000 points within the continental U.S. selected for their wind resource. This set contains power estimates and forecasts along with a subset of atmospheric variables. Data can be accessed through an [API](https://developer.nrel.gov/docs/wind/wind-toolkit/).

* [RAP](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/model-data/model-datasets/rapid-refresh-rap) is the continental-scale NOAA hourly-updated assimilation/modeling system operational at the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP). RAP covers North America and is comprised primarily of a numerical weather model and an analysis system to initialize that model. RAP provides 1-hour resolution solar radiation data, **ranging from May 2012 to date**, on a  13-km resolution horizontal grid. Data can be retrieved using the NetCDF Subset Service. Information on the interface is described [here](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/thredds/current/tds/reference/NetcdfSubsetServiceReference.html).


# Wind Power Output Calculation
* The Techno-Economic WIND Toolkit Power dataset provides a power curves for each site. In this case, the closest site to the wind generator in the network is identified and then the power for each 5-min data point is retrieved.

* RAP provides The U and V components of the wind speed at 80-m above ground every hour. This information allows to estimate the wind speed. Power curves provided by NREL in the [WIND Toolkit documentation](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy14osti/61714.pdf) are then used to convert wind speed to power. Figure 1 in the document shows the different normalized wind turbine power curves considered.
