# Introduction
REISE takes as input the power produced every UTC hour by each wind farm in the network. Wind speed data need first to be collected and then converted to power. The procedure used to achieve these goals is explained below.

# Data
1-hour resolution wind speed data are needed. In addition these data should be available for all the wind farms location in the network. In addition, the spatial resolution should be as good as possible.


Two datasets provide satisfy these requirements. The first one is the WIND (Wind Integration National Dataset) Toolkit produced by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and the second one is RAP (Rapid Refresh) generated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).
* The [WIND Toolkit](https://www.nrel.gov/grid/wind-toolkit.html) provides 1-hour resolution irradiance data for 7 years, **ranging from 2007 to 2013**, on a uniform 2-km square grid that covers the continental U.S., the Baja Peninsula, and parts of the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.
* [RAP](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/model-data/model-datasets/rapid-refresh-rap) is the continental-scale NOAA hourly-updated assimilation/modeling system operational at the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP). RAP covers North America and is comprised primarily of a numerical weather model and an analysis system to initialize that model. RAP provides 1-hour resolution solar radiation data, **ranging from May 2012 to date**, on a  13-km resolution horizontal grid.

# Wind Output Calculation
Power curves provided by NREL in the the [WIND Toolkit documentation](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy14osti/61714.pdf) are used to convert wind speed to power. Figure 1 in the document shows the different wind turbine power curves considered.
