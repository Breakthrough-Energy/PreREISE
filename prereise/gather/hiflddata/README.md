### What it does
To give more context, this new HIFLD module has two python scripts to output the transmission topology and power generation data.

- data_trans.py is the one to parse the substation, transmission csv and json raw data downloaded from HIFLD. 
  - `DataTransform(E_csv, T_csv, Z_csv)` is the main entry point in this script to all the other methods, i.e., parse, calcualte and approximate the topology information.
  - The most important internal analysis functions 
    - `def Neighbors(sub_by_coord_dict, sub_name_dict, raw_lines)`, which figures out the topology with geo coordinate information for all the transmission lines
    - `calculate_reactance_and_rateA(bus_id_to_kv, lines, raw_lines)`, which is using pre-defined line parameters and rules
    - `GetMaxIsland(G)`, which detects the connectivity of the network topology; we leverage the networkx as the Graph computing library - some of the topology calculation is done easily.

- plant_agg.py is the one to parse the generation raw data from HIFLD and EIA
  - `Plant(E_csv, U_csv, G2019_csv)` is the main entry point in this script to all other methods, i.e., cleanup, aggregate the power plant generation information.
  - The most important internal analysis function is `Plant_agg(clean_data,ZipOfsub_dict,loc_of_plant,LocOfsub_dict,Pmin)`, which aggregate the power generation based on zip code grouping
