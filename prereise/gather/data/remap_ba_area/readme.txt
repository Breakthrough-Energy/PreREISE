The BA(Balancing Authority) control area map is started from the BA_County_map.json. The following CAs (Control Area) have subregions to provide better spatial resolution.

- CISO: ca_balancing_authorities.zip.
- PJM: pjm.zip.
- NYISO: nyiso folder. The 7 upstate subregions maps (A-G) will be downloaded from internet.

The program produces the final remap_ba_area.shp shape file and a tiff image file to verify.

Some subregions are merged and the load should be aggregated to match the remap shape file.
SWPP-INDN is combined with SWPP-KCPL to map to KCPL_INDN.
ISNE-4006,  ISNE-4007, ISNE-4008 are combined into ISONE-MA.
