# Data
Solar irradiance data are needed to estimate solar power output. REISE takes as input the power produced every UTC hour by each solar plants in the network. This means that i) 1-hour resolution data are needed and ii) the data should span the entire network with good spatial resolution.

The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) provides two sets of data that achieve these goals. These are the WIND (Wind Integration National Dataset) Toolkit and the National Solar Radiation Database (NSRDB).
* The WIND Toolkit provides 1-hour resolution irradiance data for 7 years (**ranging from 2007 to 2013**) on a uniform 2-km square grid that covers the continental U.S., the Baja Peninsula, and parts of the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.
* The NSRDB provides solar radiation data (**ranging from 1998 to 2016**) for the entire U.S. and a growing list of international locations on 4-km square grid.
