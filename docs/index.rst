PreREISE
=========
This page is dedicated to the collection, processing and formatting of data that are
fed to the simulation engine. PreREISE is an open source package written in Python that
is available on `GitHub <https://github.com/Breakthrough-Energy/PreREISE>`_.

The generation of input data rely on the grid model. For this reason, you must have
`PowerSimData <https://github.com/Breakthrough-Energy/PowerSimData>`_ cloned in a
folder adjacent to your clone of PreREISE.

.. note::
    Input data are publicly available for the Breakthrough Energy Sciences (BES) grid
    model (see `publication <https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.06155>`_). You don't need to
    generate any input data if you use the scenario framework to carry out power flow
    study.


General Comments
----------------
Profiles are CSV (Comma Separated Values) files enclosing a series of data points
indexed in time orders. The simulation engine expects a demand, hydro, solar and wind
profile. All the profiles have UTC timestamp as indices. Columns are the zone IDs and
plant IDs for the demand and hydro/solar/wind profiles, respectively. Values are load in
MWh in each zone for the demand and energy generated by a 1MW generator for hydro,
solar and wind profiles.

The **[type]_v[D]** naming convention is used, where:

+ **type** specifies the profile type (demand, hydro, solar or wind) and
+ **D** refers to the date the file has been created using the 3 letters Month (e.g.,
  Jan) and 4 digits Year (e.g., 2021) format.

If two or more profiles of the same type are created the same month of the same year,
the different versions will be differentiated using a lowercase letter added right
after the year, e.g, ``demand_vJan2021.csv`` (first), ``demand_vJan2021b.csv`` (second),
``demand_vJan2021c.csv`` (third) and so forth.
