Capacity Factor
+++++++++++++++
EIA publishes US average monthly capacity factors for hydro plants. The `table
<https://www.eia.gov/electricity/annual/html/epa_04_08_b.html>`_` is used to
produce a profile for each hydro plant in the grid.

Note that we are using the same set
of capacity factors independently of the geographical location of the plant and, as a
result, the profile of all the hydro plants in the grid will have the same shape.

Check out the `hydro capacity factor notebook`_ for  a demo.
