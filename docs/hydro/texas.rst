Texas

ERCOT publishes actual generation by fuel type for each 15 minute settlement interval
(see the `fuel mix report`_ for more details). The profile of each hydro plant in the
Texas Interconnection is then simply the ratio of the total generation provided by ERCOT
divided by the total hydro capacity available in the Texas Interconnection of the grid
model.

The `texas hydro notebook`_ generates the profile.
