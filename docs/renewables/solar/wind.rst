Gridded Atmospheric Wind Integration National Dataset
#####################################################
The `Gridded Atmospheric WIND (Wind Integration National Dataset) Toolkit
<https://www.nrel.gov/grid/wind-toolkit.html>`_ provides 1-hour resolution irradiance
data for 7 years, ranging from 2007 to 2013, on a uniform 2x2 square kilometer grid
that covers the continental U.S., the Baja Peninsula, and parts of the Pacific and
Atlantic oceans. Data can be accessed using the Highly Scalable Data Service. NREL
wrote `example notebooks <https://github.com/NREL/hsds-examples>`_ that demonstrate how
to access the data.
