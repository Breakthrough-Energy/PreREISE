High-Resolution Rapid Refresh
#############
The `HRRR`_ (High-Resolution Rapid Refresh) is a NOAA real-time 3-km resolution,
hourly updated, cloud-resolving, convection-allowing atmospheric model, initialized by
3km grids with 3km radar assimilation. Radar data is assimilated in the HRRR every 15 min
over a 1-h period adding further detail to that provided by the hourly data assimilation
from the 13km radar-enhanced Rapid Refresh. Data can be retrieved from a publicly available
AWS S3 `Bucket`_.
