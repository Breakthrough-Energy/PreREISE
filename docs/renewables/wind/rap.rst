Rapid Refresh
#############
`RAP`_ (Rapid Refresh) is the continental-scale NOAA hourly-updated
assimilation/modeling system operational at the National Centers for Environmental
Prediction (NCEP). RAP covers North America and is comprised primarily of a numerical
weather model and an analysis system to initialize that model. RAP provides for every
hour ranging from May 2012 to date, the U and V components of the wind speed at 80 meter
above ground on a 13x13 square kilometer resolution grid every hour. Data can be
retrieved using the `NetCDF`_ Subset Service.
