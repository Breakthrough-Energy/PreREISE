# PreREISE
This package defines the scenario and calls the matlab simulation engine.
## Creation of a scenario
A scenario can be defined by adding an entry to the scenario list table. 
This is currently ScenarioList.csv.
Make sure you choose an unique name. Since this list is temporary an will be replaced by a database there is no check of uniqueness.
Make sure you have stored the scenario_name.m file and the related simulation and data files in the defined folder locations.
## Call the simulation engine.
After setting up the scenario, the simulation engine can be called.
