# PreREISE
**PreREISE** is part of a Python software ecosystem developed by [Breakthrough
Energy Sciences](https://science.breakthroughenergy.org/) to carry out power flow study
in the U.S. electrical grid.


## Main Features
**PreREISE** is dedicated to the building of demand, hydro, solar and wind profiles. A detailed presentation of the data source and algorithms used to generate profiles can
be found on our [docs].

---
**NOTE**

Profiles are publicly available for the Breakthrough Energy Sciences (BES)
grid model. Therefore, you donâ€™t need to generate any input data if you use the
scenario framework to carry out power flow study.

---


## Where to get it
For now, only the source code is available. Clone or Fork the code here on GitHub.


## Dependencies
**PreREISE** relies on:
* **PowerSimData**, another package developed by Breakthrough Energy Sciences and
available [here][PowerSimData].
* Several Python packages all available on [PyPi](https://pypi.org/) whose list can be
found in the ***requirements.txt*** or ***Pipfile*** files both located at the root of
this package.


## Installation
Clone **PowerSimData** in a folder adjacent to your clone of **PreREISE** as the
installation of packages depends on files in **PowerSimData**. Then, use the
***requirements.txt*** file (via `pip`) or ***Pipfile*** file (via `pipenv`) to install
third party dependencies.
